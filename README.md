Aioneer - Earn $ with Profitable Business Opportunities

Aion has partnered with African telcos and banks to finance smartphones for 200,000
consumers, addressing challenges faced by end-users, particularly women entrepreneurs,
due to limited reinvestment funds. Access to finance is mainly through informal sources.
Based on the experience, Aion shifted focus to local farming cooperatives and small
businesses, conducting a successful pilot with 350 users across 3 cooperatives in Rwanda to
finance local projects. Aion plans to scale using an ethical business partnership finance
model. The Aioneer app targets the Rwandan diaspora for projects with profit share
financing, tackling transparency and accountability issues.
